# Official implementation of Paper "Future Video Synthesis With Object Motion Prediction"(CVPR 2020)

# Enviroment

Python 3

Pytorch1.0.0

# Components

There are exists several components in our framework

- Dynamic Object Detection

- Background Prediction

- Background Inpainting following [Generative Inpainting](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting/tree/v1.0.0)

- Dynamic Object Motion Prediction

- Video Inpainting modified from [Deep-Flow-Guided-Video-Inpainting](https://github.com/nbei/Deep-Flow-Guided-Video-Inpainting)
